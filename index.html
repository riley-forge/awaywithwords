        <p>
          If you’d asked me last year what “serious” writing looked like, I would have told you:
          double-spaced, Times New Roman, black text on white paper, stapled neatly in the top left corner.
          I never thought of those things as design choices. They just felt like gravity—automatic,
          invisible, and non-negotiable. That was what good students did if they wanted to be taken seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I read Anne Wysocki, and suddenly the page itself started talking back. She pointed out that
          the materials and shapes we’re “allowed” to use—our fonts, margins, colors, and layouts—aren’t
          natural at all. They’re built over time, through institutions, technologies, and power. Someone
          decided what academic writing should look like, and we’ve all been quietly following the recipe
          without reading the fine print.
        </p>
        <p>
          So in this post, I’m inviting you into my rhetorical kitchen. Instead of a recipe for soup or cookies,
          we’re going to cook up a recipe for <strong>design</strong> itself—one that mixes awareness of constraints
          with a willingness to experiment. The dish at the end isn’t a casserole or a cake; it’s a page that
          wears its design choices out loud. Grab your metaphorical mixing bowl and your favorite font,
          and let’s start measuring out some ingredients.

      <!-- INGREDIENTS SECTION -->
      <section class="ingredients" id="ingredients">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 heaping cup of awareness of constraints</strong> – notice what feels “automatic” in your writing: fonts, spacing, margins, and where images do or don’t appear.</li>
          <li><strong>2 generous scoops of “available designs”</strong> – the recognizable patterns your readers already know, like standard essays or slideshows.</li>
          <li><strong>2 tablespoons of “unavailable designs” (room-temperature)</strong> – the choices that feel risky or out of place, such as playful layouts or nontraditional formats.</li>
          <li><strong>1 pinch of skepticism toward the word/image split</strong> – a question about why words are treated as “serious” and images as “extra.”</li>
          <li><strong>A handful of page-space experimentation</strong> – margins, line breaks, columns, and white space that change how your reader moves through the page.</li>
          <li><strong>3 teaspoons of audience awareness</strong> – a clear sense of who you’re cooking for and what they expect your work to look like.</li>
          <li><strong>1 cup of rhetorical purpose, firmly packed</strong> – a reason for composing that shapes which designs you keep and which you push against.</li>
          <li><strong>A dash of institutional flavoring</strong> – assignment sheets, rubrics, style guides, and other official constraints you can’t fully ignore.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional garnish: courage to make the page look “wrong” on purpose</strong> – the willingness to design visibly and explain why.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- DIRECTIONS SECTION -->
      <section class="directions" id="directions">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Preheat your context.</strong>
            Name your audience, purpose, and genre. Ask what this kind of writing usually looks like and whose expectations you’re working with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sift together constraints and materials.</strong>
            List your materials (paper, screen, software, fonts, images) and your constraints (word count, formatting rules, deadlines), then decide which are truly fixed and which only feel automatic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fold in your available designs.</strong>
            Add familiar patterns—clear titles, introductions, conclusions, or navigation bars—so your reader has something steady to hold onto.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir in one or two unavailable designs.</strong>
            Introduce a design move that doesn’t usually appear in school writing, such as a recipe format, unconventional headings, or hand-drawn elements that support your purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Season with skepticism toward “neutral” pages.</strong>
            Taste your draft by asking where it pretends not to be designed. Decide whether you want the page to show its seams more honestly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simmer with feedback.</strong>
            Share your draft with another reader and ask where their eyes go first, what feels clear, and what feels confusing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjust for ethics and accessibility.</strong>
            Check readability, color contrast, alt text, and overall inclusion, making sure your design invites in more readers than it shuts out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plate your final design and serve with reflection.</strong>
            Present your work in its final form and write a brief reflection that explains how your design responds to your audience, purpose, and constraints.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <!-- NOTES & VARIATIONS -->
      <section class="notes-section" id="notes">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Notes &amp; Variations</h2>
        <p><span class="variation-label">Recipe Notes:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li>This recipe adapts to different genres: research papers, digital stories, discussion posts, and beyond.</li>
          <li>Strong institutional flavor (strict formats) may limit some choices, but interesting design often happens in small details and margins.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="variation-label">Variations:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Minimalist:</strong> Use a calm layout but let one design choice—like a bold pull quote or striking color—do the loudest talking.</li>
          <li><strong>Maximalist:</strong> Layer textures, images, and sidebars while making sure every element still serves your rhetorical purpose.</li>
          <li><strong>Remix:</strong> Take a traditional paper you’ve already written and rebuild it as a zine, slideshow, comic, or recipe blog.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- ACCESSIBILITY / ETHICS BOX -->
      <section class="accessibility-section" aria-label="Accessibility and ethics tips">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Accessibility &amp; Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          Good design isn’t just eye-catching; it’s responsible. As you experiment, remember to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose fonts and sizes most readers can comfortably see.</li>
          <li>Use enough contrast between text and background.</li>
          <li>Add meaningful alt text to images so screen-reader users can access your work.</li>
          <li>Consider whose voices and bodies your design centers and whether it welcomes multiple ways of reading and speaking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Design is never neutral. The way your page looks can invite people in—or quietly push them out.
