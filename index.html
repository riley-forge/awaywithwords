      <section class="intro" aria-label="Story behind the recipe">
        <p>
          If you’d asked me last year what “serious” writing looked like, I would have responded with the answer 
          my academic training has given me: double-spaced, 12pt font, Times New Roman, black text on white paper, 
          with the occastional staple placed neatly in the top left corner. I very rarely thought of those things 
          as design choices, and never questioned their decree from an academic perspective. They felt almost as 
          constant as gravity; automatic, invisible, and non-negotiable. This format was what good students followed 
          if they wanted their work to be taken seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then this course provided me with "awaywithwords" by Anne Wysocki, and it felt as though the page itself 
          blossomed with options. She pointed out that the materials and shapes we’re “allowed” to use; fonts, 
          margins, colors, and layouts close at hand for example, aren’t natural at all. These habits of formatting 
          have been built over time, through institutions, technologies, and oftentimes power. Someone decided what 
          academic writing should look like, and while we’ve all followed the recipe, we may have inadvertently 
          hindered our capacity for creative communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            So in this assignment, I’m inviting you into my rhetorical kitchen. Instead of a recipe for soup or 
            cookies, we’re going to cook up a recipe for design, mixing awareness of constraints with a willingness 
            to experiment with surfaces and shapes that academic writing often treats as unavailable. The dish at 
            the end isn’t casserole or a cake; it’s a page that showcases its design instead of pretending to be 
            neutral, presenting design as a feature, not a bug. Grab your metaphorical mixing bowl and your favorite 
            font, and let’s start measuring out some ingredients.

      <!-- INGREDIENTS -->
      <section class="ingredients" id="ingredients">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1 heaping cup of Constraint Awareness</strong> – notice what feels “automatic” in your writing: 
            fonts, spacing, margins, and where images do or don’t appear.</li>
          <li><strong>2 generous scoops of “Available Designs”</strong> – the recognizable patterns your audience 
            already knows, like standard essays or slideshows.</li>
          <li><strong>2 tablespoons of “Unavailable Designs” (room-temperature)</strong> – the choices that feel risky 
            or out of place, such as playful layouts or nontraditional formats.</li>
          <li><strong>1 pinch of Skepticism toward the Word/Image Split</strong> – a question about why words are 
            treated as “serious” and images as “extra.”</li>
          <li><strong>A handful of Page-Space Experimentation</strong> – margins, line breaks, columns, and white space 
            that change how your reader moves through the page.</li>
          <li><strong>3 teaspoons of Audience Awareness</strong> – a clear sense of who you’re cooking for and what they 
            expect your work to look like.</li>
          <li><strong>1 cup of Rhetorical Purpose, firmly packed</strong> – a reason for composing that shapes which 
            designs you keep and which you push against.</li>
          <li><strong>A dash of Institutional Flavor</strong> – assignment sheets, rubrics, style guides, and other 
            official constraints you can’t fully ignore.</li>
          <li><strong>Optional garnish: courage to make the page look “wrong” on purpose</strong> – the willingness to 
            design visibly and explain why.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- DIRECTIONS -->
      <section class="directions" id="directions">
        <h2 class="section-heading">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Preheat your context.</strong>
            Name your audience, purpose, and genre. Ask what this kind of writing usually looks like and whose 
            expectations you’re working with.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sift together constraints and materials.</strong>
            List your materials (paper, screen, software, fonts, images) and your constraints (word count, formatting 
            rules, deadlines), then decide which are truly fixed and which only feel automatic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fold in your available designs.</strong>
            Add familiar patterns—clear titles, introductions, conclusions, or navigation bars—so your reader has 
            something steady to hold onto.
          </li>
          <figure class="hero-image">
            <img src="images/Tamarcus_Brown____KBTSP7FFIY.jpg"
            alt="A close-up shot of a hand using a pen and a ruler to draw straight lines on a blank notebook page, 
            capturing the precision and focus required for detailed work.">
            <figcaption class="hero-caption">
                Planning the layout of information on the page is part of composition, not just technical afterthought.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <li>
            <strong>Stir in one or two unavailable designs.</strong>
            Introduce a design move that doesn’t usually appear in academic writing, such as a recipe format, 
            unconventional headings, or hand-drawn elements that support your purpose. As Wysocki reminds us, page 
            shapes are historical choices, not neutral defaults.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Season with skepticism toward “neutral” pages.</strong>
            Taste your draft by asking where it pretends not to be designed. Decide whether you want the page to show 
            its seams more honestly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Simmer with feedback.</strong>
            Share your draft with another reader and ask where their eyes go first, what feels clear, and what feels 
            confusing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjust for ethics and accessibility.</strong>
            Check readability, color contrast, alt text, and overall inclusion, making sure your design invites in more 
            readers than it shuts out.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Plate your final design and serve with reflection.</strong>
            Present your work in its final form and write a brief reflection that explains how your design responds to 
            your audience, purpose, and constraints.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Accessibility &amp; Ethics</h2>
        <p>
          Good design isn’t just eye-catching; it’s responsible. As you experiment, remember to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose fonts and sizes most readers can comfortably see.</li>
          <li>Use enough contrast between text and background.</li>
          <li>Add meaningful alt text to images so screen-reader users can access your work.</li>
          <li>Consider whose voices and bodies your design centers and whether it welcomes multiple ways of reading 
            and speaking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Design is never neutral. The way your page looks can invite people in or quietly push them out. Ethical 
          design asks who a page invites onto the surface and who gets pushed off the margins, often both literally and 
          figuratively. Questioning ‘natural’ academic design widens who can participate in composing, and allows all 
          chefs a place at the table!

        <h2>Behind This Recipe - Explanation Essay</h2>
        <p>
            This multimodal recipe blog reimagines Anne Wysocki’s discussion of design, constraints,
            and “available” vs. “unavailable” forms by translating theoretical concepts into the genre
            of a cooking recipe. The familiar structure—ingredients, directions, notes, and ads—helps
            readers recognize the genre even as the content focuses on composing practices instead of food.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I began planning this project, I knew I wanted to challenge the assumption that academic 
            writing should look a certain way; Times New Roman, black-and-white, centered on alphabetic 
            text. After reading Anne Wysocki’s awaywithwords (2005), I realized those visual conventions 
            are not neutral containers for ideas but historically shaped expectations about what counts as 
            “serious.” Wysocki asks us to question why some designs become “available” and others seem 
            inappropriate or unserious, despite being technically possible. My goal in composing this webpage 
            as a recipe blog was to place design in the foreground as a central rhetorical decision rather 
            than an invisible background.
        </p>
        <p>
            The multimodal format of a recipe blog allows me to transform theoretical concepts into something 
            tactile. Instead of merely describing design principles, I wanted the page to model how material 
            choices communicate, incorporating layout, spacing, color, headings, and even the presence of 
            "advertisements", though those just lead to other course materials for now. For instance, the 
            recipe card translates abstract ideas into “ingredients,” demonstrating how rhetorical elements 
            like audience and institutional constraints can be measured and mixed. The jump-to-recipe button 
            and accessible figcaptions highlight how genre conventions guide movement throughout the page, 
            while the aforementioned ads reference other course texts to suggest a broader pantry of rhetorical 
            resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            My audience for this project is my peers, who already share experience reading multimodal theory. 
            For that reason, I wasn’t trying to simplify Wysocki but to make her ideas more experiential. The 
            recipe metaphor suggests that composition is crafted, mixed, and continually tasted rather than 
            automatically formatted, ideally focusing the reader's perspective on design as process rather than 
            final product. Ultimately, this project is meant to function as its own example of an “unavailable 
            design” inside academic expectations, an argument that the page is never neutral and that rhetorical 
            understanding depends on recognizing design not as ornamentation, but as an essential component of 
            meaning.
